# SIMULATION-AND-ANALYSIS-OF-SPECTRUM-SENSING-IN-COGNITIVE-RADIO
This project enhances Cognitive Radio (CR) using Double Threshold Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) for better spectrum utilization. It improves detection accuracy in low SNR by combining local sensing data at a Fusion Center (FC). Simulated in MATLAB &amp; SIMULINK, it optimizes bandwidth allocation and wireless communication efficiency.
