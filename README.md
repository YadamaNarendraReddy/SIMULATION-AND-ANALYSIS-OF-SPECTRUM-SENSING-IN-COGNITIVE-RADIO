# SIMULATION-AND-ANALYSIS-OF-SPECTRUM-SENSING-IN-COGNITIVE-RADIO
This project focuses on Cognitive Radio (CR) technology and its role in efficient spectrum utilization for wireless communication. The goal is to enhance existing Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN) to maximize bandwidth usage while accommodating growing network demands. The study aligns with the IEEE 802.22 standard, which identifies vacant spectrum bands in Digital TV (DTV) channels for use in wireless broadband.

Key Points:

Cognitive Radio & Spectrum Sensing:
CR technology enables secondary users (SUs) to detect and use unoccupied radio spectrum without interfering with primary users.
The core function of CR is spectrum sensing, which identifies available frequencies dynamically.

Challenges in Spectrum Sensing:

Energy detection is a commonly used technique due to its simplicity and independence from primary user data.
However, its performance drops in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, leading to unreliable detection.

Proposed Solution â€“ Double Threshold Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS):

Introduces a double-threshold approach to improve detection accuracy.
CR devices send local decisions to a Fusion Center (FC), which combines data from multiple sources for a final decision.
This method balances detection reliability and information loss.

Simulation Approach:

The project uses MATLAB & SIMULINK to model various spectrum sensing scenarios.
Evaluates both individual sensing (single unit) and collaborative sensing (multiple SUs).
The simulation results help assess the detection performance and efficiency of the proposed technique.
